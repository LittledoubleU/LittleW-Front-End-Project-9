                    <p>Why are you just standing there with your mouth gaping? Ah, you must be stunned and at a loss for words... Understandable, it is I after all... Fontaine's most beloved star, Furina. I'm on a very tight schedule, so you're lucky to even get an appointment with me.</p>

                    <p>Nice to meet you! I am Navia, the esteemed president, leader, commander-in-chief, executive director, and Boss of Spina di Rosula. You strike me as somebody special â€” a person of character. Something tells me that this is the beginning of a long partnership between us... perhaps even as long as all the titles in front of my name.</p>

                    <p>I am The Knave, Arlecchino, Fourth of the Fatui Harbingers. The children of the House of the Hearth call me "Father." I do hope our partnership proves to be a pleasant one, although I would imagine that should be fairly easy. After all, there's no cause for contention between us at the moment... wouldn't you agree?</p>
